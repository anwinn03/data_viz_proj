# data_viz_proj
A project that looks at a public company's earnings per share and provide data visualizations

This project uses ALPHA VANTAGE API key to access public comapnies' financial data.

I am currently using a given API key to access the code that I will not disclose.

This is my first ever published project. Nothing new or inspiring, but it's a start for me! :D
